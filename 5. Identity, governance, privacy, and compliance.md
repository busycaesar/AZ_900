# Authentication vs Authorization

## Authentication
- Tries to identify the person or service seeking access to resource.
- Requests access credentials.
- Basis for creating secure identity and access control principles.
## Authorization
- Determines the authenticated person's or service's access level.
- Defines what they can do with the accessible data.
## Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
Provides additional security for your identities by requiring two or more elements for full authentication.

Something you know <---> Something you possess <---> Something you are
# Azure Active Directory
Azure Active Directory is Microsoft Azure's cloud-based identity and access management service.
- Enables employees to sign in and access resources securely.
- Allows users to sign in once and access multiple applications without any need to sign in again.
- Provides tools to manage access to various applications within the organization.
- Facilitates collaboration by allowing external partners and vendors to access resources securely.
- Manages customer identities and allows them to sign in and access services.
- Ensures that only authorized and compliant devices can access resources.
# Conditional Access
Conditional Access helps enforce organizational policies by considering various signals to decide when and how users can access resources.
- Policies can apply to specific users or groups.
- Access can be restricted based on the user's IP address.
- Policies can require that access is only granted from specific devices.
- Access can be controlled based on the application being used.
- Uses signals to detect potential risks and adjust access policies accordingly. Example: If a user signs in from an unfamiliar location, they might be prompted for additional verification.
# Role-based Access Control(RBAC)
RBAC is a system used to manage who has access to Azure resources and what they can do with them.
- You can control permissions at a detailed level. Example: Allowing a user to view a database but not edit it.
- Divides responsibilities to minimize the risk of errors or misuse.
- Users get only the permissions they need to do their jobs.
- Controls access to the Azure management interface. Example: Admins can manage all resources, while developers see only their projects.
# Resource Locks
- Resource locks are a way to protect your Azure resources from accidental deletion or modification.
- Locks can be applied at different levels: subscription, resource group, or individual resource.
- Lock type: CanNotDelete, ReadOnly
# Tags
- Tags are metadata elements you can apply to your Azure resources to help organize and manage them.
- Tags help you organize resources into a taxonomy, making it easier to manage and search.
- Each tag consists of a name and a value.
- Tags are very useful for rolling up billing information. Example: Tagging resources by cost center to track expenses per department.
# Azure Policy
Azure Policy is a service in Microsoft Azure that helps you set rules for how your Azure resources (like virtual machines, databases, and storage accounts) should be configured and used. Think of it as a way to make sure that everyone in your organization follows the same rules for managing their Azure resources.
- Azure Policy evaluates your resources against the rules you’ve set.
- Azure Policy comes with pre-defined policies and initiatives that cover common scenarios like security and cost management.
- For example, there are policies to ensure that only certain types of virtual machines are used, or to make sure that encryption is enabled for storage accounts.
# Azure Blueprints
Azure Blueprints is a service that helps you set up new Azure environments quickly and consistently. It’s like a template for creating and managing all the things you need for a new project or environment in Azure.
Azure Blueprints allows you to create new environments (like development or production) quickly by using a predefined set of resources and rules.
It helps you make sure that your new environments follow organizational standards and compliance requirements.
- Assign roles to users or groups to define who can access or manage resources.
- Apply policies to enforce rules for resources.
- Templates that describe the resources needed for your environment. These templates define what resources to create (like VMs, networks, databases) and how to configure them.
- Organize resources into logical groups.
# Cloud Adoption Framework
The Cloud Adoption Framework is a set of best practices, tools, and guidance from Microsoft. It helps you plan, implement, and manage your cloud strategy effectively.
- Tools for managing your cloud environment.
- Guidance for creating a plan and strategies for moving to Azure.
- Helps you with everything from initial planning to ongoing management.
# Security, Privacy and Compliance
## Security
Security in Azure is about keeping your data and applications safe from threats and attacks.
- Azure is built with security as a top priority from the start.
- Uses automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and prevent threats.
- Helps protect against known (like malware) and unknown (like new types of attacks) cyberthreats.
## Privacy
Privacy is about ensuring that your data is handled confidentially and that you have control over it.
- Microsoft provides contracts that define how your data is used and protected.
- You have control over your data and can see how it is being used.
